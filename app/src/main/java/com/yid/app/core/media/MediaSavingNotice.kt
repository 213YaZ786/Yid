/**
 * One notification for every automatic save in progress, instead of one per
 * file.
 *
 * The files themselves are hidden from the shade by whoever enqueues them
 * (VISIBILITY_HIDDEN, which needs DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION in the
 * manifest), since twenty pictures would be twenty lines. This
 * line says how many are left, so nobody has to guess whether it is safe to
 * leave the app, then what was saved and what failed.
 *
 * Batches are pooled. Following each batch on its own let two close
 * refreshes write over each other's counts, and following it under a lock
 * held the next batch back for up to ten minutes. Here [track] only adds ids,
 * and a single watcher reports on all of them.
 *
 * Polling rather than a broadcast receiver: a receiver would have to be
 * declared in the manifest and be woken with the app closed, which
 * Yiḍ does not do.
