/**
 * Keeps the background check from being starved by battery savers.
 *
 * The check runs through WorkManager, which already survives the process
 * being killed and the phone restarting. What stops it on some phones is the
 * maker's own battery saving, which postpones or drops background work of
 * apps it has not been told to leave alone. A permanent notification was
 * considered and refused: it keeps a service alive all day to solve a problem
 * the scheduler does not have. Asking to be left out of battery optimisation,
 * once, at the moment the reader turns background checks on, is the fix that
 * targets the actual cause.
 *
 * Shared across the apps of this base: edit Modules/shared, then run sync.sh.
