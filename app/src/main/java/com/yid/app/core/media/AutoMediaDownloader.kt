/**
 * Saves the media of posts that have just arrived, without being asked, so
 * they can be read with no network.
 *
 * Into the app's own folder through [OfflineMedia], never into Downloads: the
 * point is offline reading, not filling the reader's drawer.
 *
 * Driven by a refresh of Home and by nothing else. There is no service, no
 * scheduled job and no work manager task behind this: with the app off screen
 * nothing downloads, which is the app's own rule and is stated here so the
 * next reader of this file does not go looking for the missing worker.
 *
 * What it saves is bounded three ways. A watermark, so only what is newer
 * than the moment the option was switched on is ever considered and the
 * stored backlog is never dumped into Downloads. A cap per pass, so one
 * refresh after a week away does not queue a thousand files at once, the rest
 * following on later refreshes. And the network rule the reader chose.
