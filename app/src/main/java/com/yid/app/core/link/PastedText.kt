/**
 * What goes into the search field when the reader taps paste. Pure, no Android,
 * so it can be run outside a build.
 *
 * The clipboard rarely holds a bare address. A browser's address bar does, but
 * a network's own share sheet copies a sentence with the link inside it, and a
 * long press on a link in a page can bring back the surrounding line. So the
 * address is pulled out of whatever came, rather than assumed to be all of it.
 *
 * Nothing is rejected here. A text with no address in it is handed on as it
 * stands, so the field can say what is wrong with it in its own words.
 *
 * Shared across the apps of this base: edit Modules/shared, then run sync.sh.
 * Each app says which schemeless words are links to its network.
