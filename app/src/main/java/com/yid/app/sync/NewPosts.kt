 * it is newer than the newest post already stored for that account, and it is
 * newer than the moment notifications were turned on. The second rule keeps
 * a page that reaches further back than the cache from being read as thirty
 * new posts. An account with nothing stored yet announces nothing:
 * its first fetch is a backlog, not news. Pinned posts are old by nature.
