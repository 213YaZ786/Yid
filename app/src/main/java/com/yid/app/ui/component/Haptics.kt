/**
 * Every action answers.
 *
 * A few words and no more, so the whole app speaks the same way: a light tick
 * for an ordinary tap, a firm one when something is taken or begun, a short
 * confirmation when something is finished or undone, a refusal when it did
 * not work. Around them, the pull to refresh threshold and the switches have
 * a feel of their own.
 *
 * Through the view rather than through Compose's own haptic type, because the
 * constants below are the platform's own while Compose's list has grown one
 * name at a time, and a name that does not exist in the exact version the
 * bill of materials resolves is a failed build. Those newer than the minimum
 * version fall back to the nearest older one.
 *
 * The system setting is respected on its own: a phone with haptics turned off
 * feels nothing, and nothing here overrides that.
