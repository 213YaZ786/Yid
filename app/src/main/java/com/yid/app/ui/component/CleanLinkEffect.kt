/**
 * Keeps a search field's link clean: a detour copied from a search engine or
 * another site, pasted with the button or with the keyboard, is replaced by
 * the address it stands for, so the reader never has to open it first. That
 * matters where the site itself would stop a logged out visitor.
 *
 * Offline for every detour that carries its address; Google's links that hide
 * it are asked of Google once, see RedirectResolver. [onClean] gets the clean
 * address, [onUnreadable] is called when Google did not say where one leads.
 *
 * Shared across the apps of this base: edit Modules/shared, then run sync.sh.
