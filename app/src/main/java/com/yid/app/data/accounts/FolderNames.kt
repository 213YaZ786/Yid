 * The rules for folder names, pure so they can be tested.

 * One rule matters above the others: two names that differ only in case are
 * one folder, and every account in it carries the exact spelling the list
 * shows. An earlier version deduplicated the list ignoring case but filed the
 * account under whatever was typed, so filing into "news" beside an existing
 * "News" left the account in a folder Home could not find, and the account
 * vanished from every folder but the full stream. [resolve] is what prevents
 * that here: whatever the reader types becomes the spelling already in use.
